# SonicRun 
A Simple runner game made by using python.

## Introduction:
In this project, we have made a 2D side-scrolling runner action video game called Sonic Run. A side-scrolling game, side-scroller, or horizontally-scrolling game is a video game in which the gameplay action is viewed from a side-view camera angle, and the onscreen characters can generally only move to the left or right. Endless running games are platform games in the player character is moving forward or remains in one location with background moving backwards usually procedurally generated theoretical endless game world. Game controls are limited making the character jump,attack or perform special actions. The objective of such games is to get as far as possible before the character dies .
The main objective of this game is to earn points by shooting enemies and collecting rings, but the player has to tackle some obstacles . As the game is an endless running game, the player plays until the character collides into an obstacle or an enemy.

## Conclusion:
We were successful in creating  a side-scroller game. We learnt the basics of game development and concepts of sprites, collision,hitboxes,etc .Using our knowledge in computer graphics, we demonstrated 2d geometric transformations  such as translation to move each sprite, and scaling to resize some sprites. 
This project can have scope on various ways such as sharing technology, understanding concepts, gaming skills, creativity and available technology, importance as learning point of view for children, emerging trends, etc. Besides, a side scrolling game in running genre has been quite popular in recent years, with games such as Jetpack Joyride and Temple Run gaining huge popularity.
